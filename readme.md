# MobPay - An iOS library for integrating card and mobile payments through Interswitch

This Pod enables you to integrate Interswitch payments to your mobile app

## Adding MobpayiOS to a project

## CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Mobpay into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
To get the library add the following dependency to your podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MobpayiOS'
```

Then run the following command
``` shell
pod install
```

Don't forget to use the .xcworkspace file to open your project in Xcode, instead of the .xcodeproj file, from here on out.

In the future, to update to the latest version of the SDK, just run:

```shell
pod update MobpayiOS
```
